        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Keila's Bikes started as a small bike shop in Marikina City with a simple mission: 
          to make quality bicycles accessible to every Filipino rider. What began as a passion 
          project has grown into one of the most trusted names in the Philippine cycling community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we've served thousands of riders — from weekend warriors and daily commuters 
          to competitive athletes and adventure seekers. We take pride in offering not just bikes, 
          but complete cycling solutions backed by expert advice and exceptional after-sales support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, with our online platform, we're able to reach more riders across the Philippines, 
          bringing the same quality products and personalized service that made us a local favorite 
          to customers nationwide.
